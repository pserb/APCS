Observables
-When a thinkerens has one card, it is sorted. Else, it is not sorted.
-In the start, Thinkerens give out all their cards to two people.
-Those two people proceed to the same thing until everyone has either 1 or 2 cards.
-Those who had one card gave the cards to the person who gave them the card.
-That person would then order it and give it to the person who gave it to them.
-The person who now has no cards would raise their hand to get more cards to sort.

Clean up the Process
To clean up this process, thinkerens can better split the cards into two more equal decks.

Sections:

DISCO
If stack is already sorted. you do not give to the people under you.

QCC
What makes this more efficient than prior sorting algorithms?
Is it more efficient to check if a stack is already sorted or sort it?

THINKER FIRMWARE (Instructions each turtle follows)
If stack at any time is already sorted, you can only give back, and not give away.
When you have > 1 card, give two people half your amount of cards each.
When you have = 1 card, give card to person who gave you card.
When you have = 0 card, raise hand to get more cards.
When you receive > 1 card, sort.

Sorting: Compare first indices of both stacks. Compare. Smaller value is now
added to the end of merged stack. Remove that value from its original array.
Repeat until both originals stacks are empty. If one stack is empty, while the other
is not, simply add the rest of the nonempty array into the end of the merged array.
