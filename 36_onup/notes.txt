Three types of errors to debug:
Compile-time errors - something wrong with syntax
Run-time errors - something goes wrong while program is running
Logic errors - cause the program to do the wrong thing

Compile-time errors
Spewing error messages - 100 error messages doesn’t mean 100 errors
ONLY THE FIRST error message is truly reliable.
Fix one error at a time then recompile

Weird compiler message, and it won’t go away
Read the error message, it might not make sense but it’ll tell you where the problem is

I can’t get it to compile no matter what I do
Debug by bisection:
Make a backup of the file, then delete half the code, try compiling again. If it compiles, you know the error is in the other half and vice versa.

Run-time errors
My program hangs - stops and seems to be doing nothing
Infinite recursion/loops produce a StackOverflowError

NullPointerException - you tried to access an instance var or method on an object that is currently null. String s; <- null.

ArithmeticException - divide by zero

Use print statements to see what your code is doing, but make them concise and easy to read! Maybe combine some or format them well

Logic Errors
Try tracing your code. It compiles, so it is performing as you wrote it. Trace it to see where things go wrong, and how that might be fixed.

Break up lengthy complex expressions into simpler ones to see what part of it is wrong.

USE PARENTHESES - order of operations

Print statements might not print all the time, try switching to println

The computer hates me, and the program only works when I wear my hat backward

CONSULT DUCKIE - talk to them. Discuss. Think about a solution
