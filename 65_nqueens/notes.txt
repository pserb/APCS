time spent: .4 hrs

DISCO:
* The algorithm will attempt to place the first queen in a lower row if placing
it on the top left space fails to create a solution.

QCC:
* How can we alter the algorithm to create show all solutions if a board has multiple solutions?
* How would the algorithm change if the first queen was placed at a different corner of the board?
