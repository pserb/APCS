HW60 -- A Termite is-a Turtle, a Thinker is-a Turtle

time spent:

Sorting Algorithm:
0) If your list has more than one item, split it in half and give each half to a new Thinker
1) If your list has only one item, place it on the unoccupied hand of the Thinker who gave you the item
2) When you recieve back the items that you gave away, sort them using the mergesort algorithm and hand that new sorted list to whoever gave you the items

Mergesort algorithm:
0) Compare the first items of the two lists
1) Add the lower one to the new list and remove it from the list from which it was taken
2) Repeat until all of the items are in the new list

Observables:
* Thinkeren struggled to keep it organized
* Assume that the list is only sorted when it only has one item
* Our class did not have enough people for everyone to have just one card

DISCO:
* Yet another sort algorithm, mergesort
* The idea of individual cells or "turtles" following extremely simple directions to complete a task

QCC:
* How does this algorithm play into to the efficieny that we talked about in the beginning of class? Avoiding O(n^2)?
* Thinkeren had trouble remembering where they got their items from, how can we keep track of where items come from in a code?
