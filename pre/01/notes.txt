public class <filename> {
}

Surrounds all the code of the file. It is important that the class name matches the filename (case sensitive)
ex: Hello.java --> classname is Hello


public static void main(String[] args) {
}

Surrounds all code being run -- where you would put a println statement.

javac Hello.java --> creates Hello.class
java Hello --> runs code
