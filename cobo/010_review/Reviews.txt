Oregano
This was a terrible restaurant! The pizza crust was too chewy, and I disliked
the pasta. I would definitely not come back.

-Panda
This was the best restaurant, the food was very sweet. I love their chicken and broccoli.

-MacDonald's
Unlimited amount of soda, which is good. I saw a fat rat running around the spoiled and oily food which was really nasty.

-Comida
Their ingredients are fresh. Their servers only speak Spanish, it was difficult for me to order.

-Cardamom
Their food is flavorful and it is spiced well. The food was too spicy for me.

-Korea
Large variety of food choices. Perfect spice level for me but it was too expensive.

-Sushi
I saw a fat worm coming out of the sashimi. The rude waiters would not give me a refund so I ate it and vomited.
