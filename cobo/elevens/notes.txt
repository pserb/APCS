L07: But These Go Up To Eleven
2022-03-21
time spent - many hours sadly doing it (3+ hours)


Weekend: Worked up to activity 4 (1 hour)
Monday: Worked for an hour as well
Used all of classtimes to do this as well (tried different strategies - first we just brute forced through it, then we tried reading all instructions first)


QCC:

why when I tried to get a new array to point to the specified array, it always removed the question (shuffler.java activity 3)
What are .jar and .bat files?
What is the different between an abstract class and an interface, does one contian both abstract methods and working methods while the other is just abstract?
